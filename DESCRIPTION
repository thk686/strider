Title: Strided Pointer Iterator and Range
Version: 1.0
Date: 2017-11-03
Author: Tim Keitt
Maintainer: Tim Keitt <tkeitt@gmail.com>
Description: The strided pointer adapts legacy buffers to the C++ standard library
  and range-based for-loops. Given a pointer into a multidimensional data buffer,
  one can generate an interator range using stri_begin and stri_end, strided versions
  of the standard library's begin and end. For constructing range-based for-loops,
  a stri_range class is provided. These help authors avoid integer-based indexing,
  which can impede algorithm performance. This library exists primarily to expose
  the header file to other R projects.
